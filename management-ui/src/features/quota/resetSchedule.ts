/**
 * When each row on a quota card gets its capacity back.
 *
 * A card lists several limits at once — a 5-hour window, a weekly one, a
 * handful of manual reset credits — and the only one that governs what you can
 * do next is whichever recovers first. Reading five timestamps to find it is
 * the work this moves off the user.
 *
 * Pure and React-free: `nowMs` is passed in, the quota state is read
 * structurally, and nothing here imports the store.
 *
 * Related but deliberately separate from `buildTimelineLane` in
 * quotaTimelineModel.ts. That reads the same five shapes to pick *one* window
 * per credential — the longest that fits the visible span, because a fortnight
 * drawn from 5-hour windows is 67 unreadable slivers. This wants *every*
 * instant and the *soonest* of them. Same inputs, opposite selection rules;
 * merging them would mean one function with a mode flag and two sets of pinned
 * tests fighting each other.
